# Loose vs. Strict Equality in JavaScript: Handling Null and Undefined

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug stemming from the misuse of equality operators when handling null and undefined values.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, which incorrectly uses strict equality (`===`) to check for null.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version using loose equality (`==`).

This example highlights the importance of understanding the nuances between loose and strict equality in JavaScript and choosing the appropriate operator based on the specific scenario.
